# nanomade
Klayout code to generate test structures for UV lithography fabrication of 2D materials.

Patterns include:
- A siemens star for resolution tests
- Parallel lines
- A spiral
- A ruler pattern
- A vernier ruler
- A alignment mark using vernier rulers


## siemens star
A resolution test that is comprised of n identical triangles spaced equidistant around a central point



## Hallbar 
A parametric design for a hall bar 

- **Layer** - Defines the Layer of the main structure of the hall bar
- **Layer 2** - Defines the layer of the side contacts
- **Gap between side contacts** - The distance in $\mu m$
